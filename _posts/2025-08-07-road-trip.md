# Plan a Road Trip with AI/UI

I was planning a road trip, and I was using the following tools to track the places to stop at:
- google search
- alltrails
- google maps
- google sheets
- google drive "My Maps"

So many tabs and kept on going back and forth... so my idea here is to streamline this as much as possible into a cohesive workflow.

Start with a `from`, `to` and optional `waypoints` if you want to go a specific general route. Of course you can then search along the route inline for attractions and add them as stops.

The direction I am taking is you then prompt it and is scaffolds you a suggested trip, which you can then edit.

Let me know if you are interested in this.
