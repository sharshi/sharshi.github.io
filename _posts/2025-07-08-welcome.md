# Welcome

I'll be covering:

- **Product Development**: Insights from building and scaling apps to 35,000+ monthly active users
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, lessons learned, and technical deep-dives
- **Mobile Development**: Experiences from building iOS apps and navigating the App Store


My most successful project has been the Siddur Torah Ohr app - a Jewish prayer book that helps users find relevant prayers based on their location, date, and time. Watching it grow from an idea to an app used by tens of thousands of people monthly has been incredibly rewarding.

I've also enjoyed building web applications, apis, AI slop, and experimenting with game development.
