# Siddur Torah Ohr, Chabad

A comprehensive Jewish prayer book application that has grown to serve over **35,000 monthly active users** worldwide.

## The Challenge

Traditional prayer books are static, but Jewish prayers vary significantly based on:
- Time of day
- Date in the Hebrew calendar
- Geographic location
- Jewish holidays and special occasions

Users often struggled to find the correct prayers for their specific situation.

## The Solution

I built an intelligent prayer app that automatically displays the relevant prayers based on:

### üóìÔ∏è **Smart Calendar Integration**
- Hebrew calendar calculations
- Holiday detection and special prayers
- Time-based prayer selection (morning, afternoon, evening)

### üìç **Location-Aware Features**
- GPS-based prayer time calculations
- Regional custom variations
- Travel mode for different time zones

### üéØ **User Experience**
- Clean, readable interface optimized for prayer
- Offline functionality for use anywhere
- Customizable text sizes and themes

## Technical Implementation

**Built with:**
- **iOS Native Development** - Swift for optimal performance
- **Core Location** - Precise location services for prayer times
- **Jewish Calendar APIs** - Accurate Hebrew date calculations
- **Local Storage** - Offline-first architecture

## Impact

- **35,000+ Monthly Active Users**
- **4.8-star rating** on the App Store
- **Global reach** across multiple countries
- **Daily usage** during prayer times

## Key Learnings

Building and scaling this app taught me valuable lessons about:

1. **User-Centered Design** - The interface needed to be calm and distraction-free
2. **Cultural Sensitivity** - Working closely with religious authorities for accuracy
3. **Performance Optimization** - Ensuring fast startup times for daily use
4. **Global Accessibility** - Supporting multiple languages and regions

## Future Enhancements

Currently exploring:
- Apple Watch companion app
- Advanced personalization features
- Community features for congregations
