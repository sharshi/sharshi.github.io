# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to start sharing my experiences as a software engineer and product builder. Over the years, I've learned valuable lessons from building and maintaining applications used by thousands of people worldwide.

## What You Can Expect

In this blog, I'll be covering:

- **Product Development**: Insights from building and scaling apps to 35,000+ monthly active users
- **Software Engineering**: Best practices, lessons learned, and technical deep-dives
- **Mobile Development**: Experiences from building iOS apps and navigating the App Store
- **Startup Life**: The challenges and rewards of building products people actually use

## My Journey So Far

My most successful project has been the Siddur Torah Ohr app - a Jewish prayer book that helps users find relevant prayers based on their location, date, and time. Watching it grow from an idea to an app used by tens of thousands of people monthly has been incredibly rewarding.

I've also enjoyed building web applications like Web Hunt (inspired by Product Hunt) and experimenting with game development through projects like Tidy Albatross.

## Looking Forward

I'm passionate about building products that solve real problems and create value for users. Through this blog, I hope to share what I've learned and connect with other developers and product builders.

Thanks for reading, and I look forward to sharing more insights with you!
